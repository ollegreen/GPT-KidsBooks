# Book-GPT

This project is the next step in the road to writing books using the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-3). This project is to build a custom autoregressive language model that focuses on writing books. Specifically: kids books.

## Note:

This algorithm will not be as advanced as ChatGPT or any of these huge language models. But instead we will focus on trying to make a subsection of text to be hopefully pretty good: generating kids stories.
