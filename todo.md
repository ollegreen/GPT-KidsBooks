### data gathering
- [x] start by getting and using the tiny shakespear dataset that is open source from Andrej Karpathy

When you have time, get a dataset of kids book texts from;
- [ ] Gutenberg picture books: [link](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/14872/pg14872-images.html)
- [ ] Freekidsbooks.org: [link](https://freekidsbooks.org/)

### pre-processing
- [ ] get it ready and encoded for model training (tensor + encodings)

### Model Experimentation & Training
- [ ] write up transformer logic on sketch / note
- [ ] build small model with well documented logic using Andrej Karpathy https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY
- [ ] train small dataset (tiny shakespear 1MB dataset) to begin with before feeding in larger amounts
- [ ] feed in and train on larger dataset of books

### post-processing
- [ ] Make it into a PDF.

### UX/UI
- [ ] upload sketch of flow from Muse app.
- [ ] use the ´loader = PyPDFLoader('data/kids_story.pdf')´  and create a PDF as base for each age group, so it uses the info from each PDF to understand the style of kids text book that should be generated.
